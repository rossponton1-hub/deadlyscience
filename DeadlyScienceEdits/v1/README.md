## Support & Questions

### Common Questions:

**Q: Why don't virtual rows have "Open Session" links?**  
A: Virtual sessions are survey-led. Demographics come from teacher submissions, not manual entry. Use "Resend" action instead.

**Q: What if I type a wrong edit parameter?**  
A: Gracefully ignored. Page loads normally, no scroll, no error.

**Q: Can I use this in production?**  
A: This is a prototype. For production, implement in Salesforce Lightning with proper record IDs and navigation.

**Q: Does this work on mobile?**  
A: Yes. Tested at 360px viewport width. All features work, layout adapts.

**Q: What if JavaScript is disabled?**  
A: Links still navigate correctly. Only scroll animation won't work.
