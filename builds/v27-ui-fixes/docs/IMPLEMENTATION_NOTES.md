# v27 UI Fixes – Implementation Notes

## Overview
The v27 build applies a combined logic and UI audit across all prototype HTML screens. Updates focus on accessibility, schema alignment with `Session__c` and `Survey_Response__c`, responsive behaviour, and presenter experience improvements including Presenter Tools Online visibility.

## Key Fixes
- Added skip-link support, `role="main"`, focusable `main` landmarks, and live region labelling on every page to satisfy accessibility and mobile navigation expectations.
- Hardened filter interactions (Session Finder, Deliver Session, Deliver Virtual) with keyboard-friendly buttons, `aria-pressed` synchronisation, and default state resets.
- Surfaced Presenter Tools Online controls on in-person and virtual delivery flows with copy-link fallback logic, schema call-outs, and coverage messaging.
- Expanded data completeness messaging to reference the exact Salesforce fields used for validation and clarified reminder schedules.
- Provided responsive spacing tweaks and alert roles across dashboards to improve readability on smaller screens.

## Schema & Logic Alignment
- **Session__c**: Attendance requirements reference `Total_Students__c`, `Year_Levels__c`, and `ATSI_Count__c`. Presenter Tools callouts highlight `Presenter__c` ownership and reminder CC behaviour.
- **Survey_Response__c**: UI copy clarifies the separation between teacher feedback and student survey response types, and Presenter Tools buttons emphasise reminder triggers.
- **Delivery Links**: Copy-link helpers degrade gracefully when `navigator.clipboard` is unavailable using textarea fallbacks.

## Logic Flow Mapping
- **Data Completeness → Delivery**: Every actionable row now exposes a mode-aware “Open Delivery” button. In-person rows deep link to `deliver_session.html` with the relevant `edit` anchor, while virtual rows open `deliver_virtual.html` so facilitators can manage QR display and teacher follow-up from the correct workspace.
- **Back Navigation Guarantee**: Both delivery workspaces honour a `from=data-completeness` query string (in addition to referrer detection) to un-hide the back-to-dashboard link when launched from fixes, ensuring the workflow can be closed without manual history navigation.
- **Resolution Flow Card**: The dashboard surfaces an explicit three-step flow (review alert → launch workspace → confirm closure) so operators know which actions sit with presenters versus teachers. Non-actionable historical clean-up items remain out of scope for the UI.

## QA Notes
- Verified Presenter Tools banners hide/show messaging based on session ownership (`currentUser`).
- Skip links now land focus on the main landmark thanks to tabindex management.
- Confirmed filter resets and keyboard navigation across all chip groups update counts via `aria-live` result summaries.
- Data tables now expose headings via labelled regions for screen readers.
